# SQL---Assignment3
2, DML COMMENTS 

In this assignment, we are creating a Managers table with specific fields and constraints to ensure data integrity, inserting sample data for 10 managers, and writing SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data. These queries include fetching specific records (e.g., by Manager_Id), calculating annual income, excluding specific managers, and filtering data based on conditions like department, salary, and salary range. This demonstrates the practical application of SQL for database creation, data management, and retrieval.
